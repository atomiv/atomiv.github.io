<h2>Software design &amp; development</h2>

<p>Our services span the whole software development process, from concept to testing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Business requirements analysis</li>
<li>Software architecture design</li>
<li>Software quality assurance</li>
<li>Technical training &amp; coaching</li>
</ul>

<h3>Business requirements analysis:</h3>

Identifying core&nbsp;business requirements is&nbsp;critical to project success. We adopt an 80-20 approach to help work with you to identify the requirements and core functionalities that matter the most to your business. We use rapid prototyping to help ensure that your business requirements are understood. We work with you to formulate your key objectives and document use cases and workflows, as well as creating prototypes of graphical user interfaces.

<h3>Software architecture design:</h3>

Our goal is to design scalable and flexible software architectures. We develop and design quality software architecture which supports modularity, configurability, and extensibility. We also recognize that software requirements change over time and that is why we seek&nbsp;to avoid over-engineering but instead capture fundamental elements in architecture and create a robust foundation which allows modifications as user requirements change.

<h3>Software quality assurance:</h3> We strive to ensure that our software fulfills <em>external</em> and&nbsp;<em>internal</em> quality criteria. Testing external software quality helps ensure that the software meets business requirements and provides business value. Testing internal software quality helps ensure that software is easy to maintain, enables adaptations to changing business requirements, and is efficient and robust.

<h3>Technical training &amp; coaching:</h3>

Our technical training services are designed to help software developers (both junior and senior) enhance skills in software design, software development and best practices. We offer short courses in C#.NET and Java as well as specialized courses in design patterns and mathematical computing. Our training is delivered remotely via skype and/or email. We also offer customized coaching to help clients in their day-to-day projects.
