# Network

Network security should be taken into account when setting up a wireless network. Each organization has a different privacy policy, so some networks may be set to access the network using a public key, and some with unique logs that each employee or member of the organization receives from the system administrator or network manager.

There are two basic types of networks:

* Infrastructure mode,
* Ad hoc mode.

## Infrastructure mode

This environment is mainly used for homes, small office or home office and uses the access point to communicate with the wireless device. The access point and clients must be configured to use the same network name. The access point is wired to a router or switch to give customers access to the internet, printers or some peripheral devices.

### What is an Access Point?

A device that creates a wireless local area network that can be used to relieve one WLAN network or to increase the signal range. AP connects to the router by cable or wirelessly and can be configured as a separate wireless network with a special network name.
