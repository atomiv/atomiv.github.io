<!-- TODO: VC: I think this is now redudant because we already have the Why at the top -->
<!--
Why should every company have processes?
-->

<!-- TODO: VC: Check with TG if we will have this -->

<!--
(warning: if you are running or working in a company who has no space for improvement and working with a highly self-organized team, standardized process and software solutions, feel free to skip it, you already know what to do.) 
- ovo je opciono totalno, cilj je bio da ova recenica predstavi idealan scenario i kompaniju, koja realno ne postoji, sto znaci da su procesi potrebni svima
-->

We are living in a time where everything should be delivered super fast but with high quality. It doesn't matter if that is a service or a product, the outcome should be the same. If you miss your chance, the competition will take it, you do not need to doubt that.

<!-- (note:  add option where company or people tried this) -->

That is why, for all of us it is important to use time and be efficient as much as it is possible. Even if you are a CEO, project manager, team lead, scrum master or process manager, we all have the same goal. 

<!-- (note: add team productivity in previous paragraph) -->

We all want for our business to grow, make higher revenue, be more profitable and inspire people to be the best version of themselves. Well, let me tell you something. None of those things will happen if you don’t know why you are doing things you are doing, and if you are wasting your time on things which are irrelevant to your business.

Want to know how to go over it? The answer is simple, start making changes with processes. 

All you have to do is to find out what works the best, document it and implement step by step.
It is called process identification, improvement and implementation.

(note: include Atomiv, how we are doing that and what we are offering)

<!-- TODO: VC: Review with TG, this was previously inside the project management section but I moved it up here because I think it's common for the rest as well, but anyway we can discuss -->

## For Teams

The processes which you document, establish, improve and at the end implement will give you enormous benefits and time to focus on things which really matter.

You will feel next:

1. Increase of time -  this will allow you to realize where your company or career is going, where do you want to be and how to accomplish all of that
2. The team will have higher motivation - people love when they see the purpose of their work, their achievements and to feel useful. The processes will help them to avoid mistakes and work repetition, which will automatically rise productivity 
3. When productivity goes up the profitability follows -  avoiding work repetition allows the team to either do more for less time or to improve their knowledge which will bring more value in the future. Anyway, a win-win situation! 
4. Higher profitability, growth and goal accomplishment - at this point, you can focus on your goals, team goals and make sure that you are all growing together 

So, here it is, short but simple and sweet “why” and “how” processes will help you, no matter if you are running a business, managing a team, project or just want to improve things and be better at your job.

Don’t get scared, be open minded, give your best and find your way how to do it.

This is just the beginning, we will reinforce these facts with real situations and solutions which I am sure all of us already experienced!

## For Project Managers 

Let’s say that you are a project manager trying to keep up with deadlines and budget but you still need to help your team because they are again struggling with the same issue as they did in the previous 2 or 3 projects. This is very frustrating for both sides.

You feel exhausted, lost, can not focus on your job and what really matters. The team is unmotivated too, because they keep trying and giving their best, but still without proper and expected results.

And then again and again, and you find yourself in the vicious cycle. 

The company is making no progress, tapping in the place, losing the team, motivation and the focus. 

Hey, no worries, these things may happen but they can be solved!

By adopting Atomiv, it helps provide you with a template for managing your projects, so that you can execute your projects smoothly, help your team work productively and achieve the project goals.

## For Senior Developers

Senior developers often have a key role in the design and architecture of software solutions - whether it's for products, projects, or modules. Aside from that, they are also involved in mentoring and supporting junior developers during development as well as code reviews. From technical perspectives, senior developers are key stakeholders in decisions regarding architecture and quality, building code re-usable, collaboration and knowledge sharing.

At some point in time, as teams and companies grow, they reach a point at which senior developers are not just involved in individual projects, but also in systematizing and standardizing development across the team - which involves often companies producing internal shared code, internal package manager setup, internal samples and templates, etc. based on best practices and coaching team members to push forward adoption. However, this can a time-consuming process, taking months or years to create the adequate code base, yet alone to implement it in practice.

Atomiv can support senior developers so that next time when they need to setup a new project, that they can get it up and running very fast. It also serves to support them in promoting standardization within the teams.

## For Junior Developers

Junior developers are an important part of software teams. When junior developers are provided with a solid foundation in software practices and clean code examples, they will be able to contribute with high productivity to software development. This is also an important asset for companies - to be able to grow talent in-house, which can be less expensive and less time-consuming than hiring externally. Over time, these juniors become more experienced and they can mentor and support the next generation of developers.

However, junior developers, a blank slate, can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, if junior developers are provided with the right foundation, working on a project which follows best practices, then those juniors can learn by example, and further contribute to the project success. On the other, if junior developers are provided with a poor foundation, working on a project with low quality code, then since this is all they've seen, the poor code will exponentially multiply as the team grows, further decreasing quality and productivity.

This is where Atomiv can help - by providing a template for the entire project architecture and with end-to-end sample working code, developed with best practices in mind, it provides junior developers with practical quality examples so that they can follow the template and apply it for new features and functionalities.
