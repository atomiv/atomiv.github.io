		<h2>What is the organizational vision?</h2>

		<p>The company vision communicates the future-based long-term goals and aspirations of the organization. It's like taking out the telescope and looking at the farthest stars. It answers the question: Where is this company going in the future? What does this company hope to achieve? What does this company hope to become in the future? What impact does the company want to make in the future?</p>

		<p>By identifying these ultimate goals, it provides a long term organizational roadmap. Thus, the vision is key to the strategic plan. It provides foresight and direction to the employees, inspiring them to reach the company goals. It provides direction to the company leaders and managers to develop the business in the long-term.</p>

		<p>The vision statement is aspirational and forward-thinking, it's going beyond what others have achieved and it's extending the limits of what is possible. The vision is the big company dream, the significant impact it will have on the world. The vision has an element of innovation, risk and excitement, it's a powerful force that drives the company to the next level.</p>

		<h2>How does vision affect organizational success?</h2>

		<p>Vision, <a href="{{ site.url }}/codex/mission">mission</a> and values are the core elements of successful IT organizations. These reflect the the organizational ideals and aspirations, and what it hopes to achieve, condensed through powerful statements, which serve as both internal and external communication tools - shared with employees, customers, partners and other stakeholders, providing them with a concrete way to understand the company.</p>

		<p>They have a critical impact on long term success - affecting the leadership approach, providing direction to sales and marketing. It enables the organization to develop highly engaged and mobilized employees, who serve as highly motivated company ambassadors and who put in 100% into the company. This leads to increased productivity and profitability.</p>
	
		<p>When there is a missing vision, then there is no well defined goal, causing people in the organization to wander. When there is a weak vision, we lose motivation from employees. When there is an inconsistent vision, whereby on vision is defined on paper but yet another vision is propagated through leadership and management, then the organization moves in conflicting directions, thereby failing to achieve organizational goals.</p>
	
		<p>A well-defined vision results very clear goals for the entire organization, across both management and operational levels. It gives everyone a sense of purpose, and achieving goals that lead towards that vision provides both leaders and employees satisfaction. This further motivates everyone to continually grow the organization, with every step moving up and up, closer and closer to the vision, the whole organization moving towards a shared target. These benefits extend beyond the boundaries of the organization - it grows trust not only between employees but also in interactions with customers and suppliers, leading to strong long-term relationships woven around the vision.</p>

				<p class="card-text">In some organizations there is no vision statement defined at all, not even formally. However, more commonly, there is a vision statement but it is unclear or vague, or the formal vision differs from the vision promoted by leadership in practice. The result is that people are moving in opposing directions and the organization fails to achieve its vision.</p>
