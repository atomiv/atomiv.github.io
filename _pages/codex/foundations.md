Why is development at first fast, but then slows down?

Why are software development late?

Why is it so hard to find “good” developers?

Why is there a big difference between developers?

Why is there a wall between technical and management?

Why does it take so long to change the system?

<h2>Principles: Asking the what?</h2>


Optivem Codex is an organizational model for achieving high performing IT teams. It combines a balanced technical and management appraoch, merging both computer scinece and pschology to get the best results.

The principles are as follows:
* Success is a synergy
* System is as strong as its weakest link

This means rather than blaming leadership or developers or any group individually to instead direct constructively  so that each component becomes stronger.

This means for example, just management training or psychology without underlying technical understanding, program will have deficiencies if no technical training. This is akin to taking a tradesman, telling him motivational quotes but not providing him with adequate training in his tools. “You can do it”, “You will succeed”.

Furthermore, just tools training is not enough , there must be motivation and a sense of purposefulness. The difference in performance later comes especially to these cognitive factors, how do people feel? Pure talent, but without motivation and energy, no work done or bare minimum results.


The underlying principles of success behind Vemcode is a birectional holisitic approach, whereby high performance is achieved through holistic approach:
* Technical excellence and motivation at the level of the individual, having expertise and knowing both technical principles,and concepts as well as realization, professionalism and taking responsibility and professionally executing work with highest standards of quality, continually growing
* Leadership and teamwork (both at team level and at organizational level), having a clear vision, shared values and goals, to achieve synergy effect, whole is greater than the sum of parts, instead of boxed individuals that they are more fluid like water and Cross-Domain transfer
* Parallel standardisation and innovation co-evolving towards even higher standards of performance, on one hand discipline in following standards but on the other hand creativity and freedom to innovate, hand-in-hand


<h3>Stage 1: Setting the right foundation</h3>

The foundation, the "roots" of success start with the Organizational Culture and Values. To achieve the synergy effect, and holistic approach to organizational success, it is necessary to value both technical excellence but on the other hand also transformational leadership to make the best use of technical capability and move towards a common goal. The foundational roots are structure and control, efficiency, stability, standards, systematization, doing things right - i.e. the foundation is high quality standards and motivating the entire systemtic success across the entire team (and organization). 

After systematic success if achieve, we encourage innovation, creativity, risk, experimentation to raise the bar higher, what we can do even better, take the system to the next level of excellence. Thus, innovation mutually co-exists with standardization and feeds back into the organizational tree to make the roots even stronger.

We then start achieving rapid growth, multiplicative success.
